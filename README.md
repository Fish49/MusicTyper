these are reserved keywords that the program uses to interpret your script
- ### Settings:
    - #### song < title >
        - sets the title of the song
        - default is untitled
    - #### by < author >
        - sets the auther of the song
        - default is John Doe
    - #### output < path > ( wav | mp3 | midi )
        - sets the path for the song to be output
        - by default, the song wont output at all
    - #### tempo < number >
        - sets  the tempo for the song in beats per minute, or if a unit of time is specified, 1 beat per that unit of time
        - default is 120 bpm
    - #### duration < time >
        - sets the total length of the song
        - default is 3 minutes
    - #### timesig < top > < bottom >
        - sets the time signature for the song
        - default is 4 4 time, or common time
    - #### keysig < note > ( major | minor )
        - sets the key signature for the song
        - defaul is C major
    - #### tune < frequency >
        - sets tuning of A above middle C, in hertz
        - default is 440hz
    - #### sample < samplerate >
        - sets the sample rate of the song
        - default is 44.1K or 44100 samples per second
    - #### channel ( mono | stereo )
        - determines whether the song has one or two channels
        - default is stereo
- ### Variables:
    - #### open ( path | wav | mp3 | ogg )
        - returns the sound wave of the file at the specific path
    - #### def < function >
        - defines a function, at indents below
    - #### return < variable >
        - returns a variable from a function
    - #### div < name >
        - creates a divider with specified name. all indented code under it is in its domain.
    - #### pure ( sine | square | sawup | sawdown | triangle ) < duration > [ frequency ] [ amplitude ] [ phase ]
        - returns a pure wave of specified type for specified duration
        - default frequency is middle C, amplitude is -5db, phase is 0sm
    - #### white < seed >
        - generates white noise with specified seed
    - #### pitch < sound > < to > [ from ]
        - returns the input sound at the new pitch
        - default from value is middle C
    - #### pitchrelative < sound > < amount >
        - returns the input sound, pitched by the desired amount of half - steps
    - #### positive < sound >
        - maps -1 to zero, 0 to 0.5, and 1 to 1. ( ( x + 1 ) / 2 )
        - useful for creating masks
    - #### add < sound > < position > [ onto ] [ start | end | middle ] [ L | R | both ]
        - adds the sound onto specified other sound at the specified channel
        - specified channel is irrelevant if both tracks are mono or both are stereo
        - start, end, and middle mean it will start, end, or be in the middle of the specified position
        - default onto is the main song file. default edge is start. default channel is both
    - #### join < sound1 > < sound2 >
        - appends sound2 to the end of sound1
    - #### reshape < sound > ( split | merge | L | R )
        - changes stereo to mono or vice versa
        - L discards right channel, R discards right channel, merge combines the two channels, and split copies the mono channel to a new right and left for stereo
        - stereo tracks are unaffected by split, and mono tracks are unaffected by merge, L, and R
        - by default it will split mono tracks and merge stero tracks

## Units:
#, $, and % represent sharp, flat, and natural respectively
each unit is a suffix for its value ( ex. 440hz )
- ### Units of time:
    - #### samples
        - number of sound wave samples, usually 44100 per second ( 44100sm )
        - ex. 500sm
    - #### seconds
        - ex. 3s
    - #### minutes
        - ex. 3m
    - #### beats
        - ex. 3b
    - #### measures
        - some multiple of beats, depending on time signature
        - ex. 20me
    - #### song fractions
        - fractions of the total length of the song
        - ex. 1/2fr, 2/7fr, 0.2fr
- ### Units of frequency:
    - #### hertz
        - ex. 440hz
    - #### scale degree
        - from the base of whatever key signature the song is in
        - ex. in C major, 0sd is middle C, 1sd is D, and -1sd is B
    - #### note name
        - simple note name
        - ex. C4n, C4#n, D2#n, A5$n,
    - #### half steps:
        - like absolute degrees, but the number represents the number of half-steps
        - ex. 0hs is middle C, 1hs is C#, -1hs is B
    - #### bpm:
        - beats per minute
        - ex. 120bpm
- ### Units of amplitude:
    - #### amplitude degree
        - fraction of the clip distance. this is not linear.
        - ex. 1.0ad is clip volume, 0.1ad is kinda quiet, 0.3ad is full - bodied
    - #### decibels (full scale)
        - decibels from 8-bit clip distance
        - ex. 0db is the loudest possible, -3db is normal
- ### Signal and Melody:
    - ### signal
        - a signal is an array of of amplitudes
    - ### melody
        - a melody is an array of frequencies

## Operations
- ### Casting:
    - casting from a number to any kind of unit is self explanitory
    - casting from frequency to time does the reciprical of the frequency ( duration(2hz) would be 0.5 )
    - casting from time to frequency does the reciprical of the time ( frequency(5s) would be 0.2hz )
    - frequency and time cant be casted to or from amplitude.
- ### Addition:
    - adding two signals is the same as playing them at the same time, it simply overlays them together
    - adding two frequencies, time scales, or amplitude units will give the numerical sum of their values
    - adding two numbers gives their sum
    - adding a signal with an amplitude offsets the whole signal by that amplitude ( mostly for masking )
- ### Multiplication:
    - multiplying two signals will give their product at each index. if the signals arent the same length, any overhang will be set to zero
    - multiplying a sound wave with a number will multiply it by that number at every index ( scaler multiplication )
    - multiplying a sound wave with an amplitude will scale it down by that amplitude
